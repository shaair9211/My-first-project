# Object Tracking Program
A computer vision algorithm that can analyze videos and recognize different vehicle types, track their movements, and assess their trajectories.
 Now this program will draw lines as trajectories to the vehicle path. Then it will send the initial x-coordinate, initial y-coordinate, final x-coordinate and final y-coordinate value to the excel sheet and save them after confirming via the confirmation dialog.
